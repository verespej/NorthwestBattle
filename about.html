				A compilation of the top teams from seven Startup Weekend 
				events throughout the northwest will be battling for pride, 
				glory and AMAZING prizes. We expect 300+ people to come out 
				for the showdown, our judging panel will be filled with some 
				of the best and the brightest, (including the CEO of UP 
				Global himself!), and we'll have plenty of drinks and snacks 
				available at the bar after the pitches are complete. Come 
				out, network with people from all over the region, celebrate 
				Startup Weekend and have some fun.
